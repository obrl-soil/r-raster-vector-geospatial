In this episode, we will open and plot point, line and polygon vector data
stored in shapefile format in `R`.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `sf` package to work with vector data in `R`. Notice that the
`rgdal` package automatically loads when `sf` is loaded. We will use the
`raster` package, which has been loaded in previous episodes, so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.

```{r load-sf, results='hide'}
library(sf)
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
* A line shapefile representing roads, and
* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/collection-methods/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank">flux tower</a>
located at the
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank"> NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import
shapefiles we use the `sf` function `st_read`.

`st_read()` requires the file path to the shapefile.

Let's import our AOI.

```{r Import-Shapefile}
# Import a polygon shapefile
aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read(
  "data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
```

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into `R` (as our
`aoi_boundary_HARV` object), the `st_read()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
**metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of
the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object.

> ## Data Tip
> The [Shapefile Metadata & Attributes in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/)
> episode provides more information on both metadata and attributes
> and using attributes to subset and plot data.

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the
extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `st_geometry_type`, `st_crs` and `st_bbox` methods:

```{r view-metadata}
# view just the geometry type for the shapefile
st_geometry_type(aoi_boundary_HARV)

# view just the crs for the shapefile
st_crs(aoi_boundary_HARV)

# view just the extent for the shapefile
st_bbox(aoi_boundary_HARV)

# view all metadata at same time
aoi_boundary_HARV
```

Our `aoi_boundary_HARV` is an `sf` polygon object,
in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object
`extent` values as it specifies units.

    west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

## Spatial Data Attributes
Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row"
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    <figcaption>Each spatial feature in an R spatial object has the same set of
    associated attributes that describe or characterize the feature.
    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. Attribute data can be
    compared to a spreadsheet. Each row in a spreadsheet represents one feature
    in the spatial object.

We can view the attributes of an `sf` object by printing it to the screen. The geometry of the object can be dropped by turning the object into a `data.frame`.

``` {r Shapefile-attributes-2}
aoi_boundary_HARV

# alternate way to view attributes
data.frame(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```

In this case, our polygon object only has one attribute: `id`.

## Metadata & Attribute Summary
We can view a metadata & attribute summary of each shapefile by entering
the name of the `R` object in the console. Note that the metadata output
includes the **geometry type**, the number of **features**, the **extent**, and the
**coordinate reference system** (`crs`) of the `R` object. The output of `summary()` shows a preview of the `R` object **attributes**.

```{r shapefile-summary}
# view a summary of metadata & attributes associated with the spatial object
summary(aoi_boundary_HARV)
```


# Plot a Shapefile
Next, let's visualize the data in our `sf` object using the `ggplot` package.

``` {r plot-shapefile}
# create a plot of the shapefile
# 'size' sets the line width
# 'fill' sets internal color
# 'color' sets line color
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, size = 3, color = "black", fill = "cyan1") + 
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot")
```

## Plot Multiple Shapefiles

The `ggplot` package can be used for basic plotting of spatial objects.
We use multiple calls to `geom_sf` to overlay shapefiles on top of each other, as
we would when creating a map in a typical GIS application like QGIS.

```{r plot-multiple-shapefiles}
# Plot multiple shapefiles
# use the pch element to adjust the symbology of the points
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "lightgreen") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV) + 
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, pch = 19, color = "purple") + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

> ## Data Tip

This episode covers how to improve plotting output using the `rasterVis` package
in `R`. Specifically it covers using `levelplot()` and adding meaningful custom
names to bands within a `RasterStack`.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

# Create list of NDVI file paths
all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/NDVI", full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".tif$")

# Create a time series raster stack
NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)

# apply scale factor
NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000

```

## Plot Raster Time Series Data
We can use the `plot` function to plot our raster time series data.

```{r plot-time-series }
# view a histogram of all of the rasters
# nc specifies number of columns
plot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
     zlim = c(.15, 1),
     nc = 4)

```

> ## Data Tip
> The range of values for NDVI is 0-1.
> However, the data stored in our raster ranges from 0 - 10,000. If we view the
> metadata for the original .tif files, we will see a scale factor of 10,000 is
> defined.
> Multiplying values with decimal places by a factor of 10, allows the data to be
> stored in integer format (no decimals) rather than a floating point format
> (containing decimals). This keeps the file size smaller.

Our plot is nice however, it's missing some key elements including, easily
readable titles. It also contains a legend that is repeated for each image. We
can use `levelplot` from the `rasterVis` package to make our plot prettier!

* <a href="http://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/" target="_blank">More on
the `rasterVis` package</a>

The syntax for the `levelplot()` function is similar to that for the `plot()`
function. We use `main = "TITLE"` to add a title to the entire plot series.

```{r levelplot-time-series }
# create a `levelplot` plot
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          main = "Landsat NDVI\nNEON Harvard Forest")

```

## Adjust the Color Ramp
Next, let's adjust the color ramp used to render the rasters. First, we
can change the red color ramp to a green one that is more visually suited to our
NDVI (greenness) data using the `colorRampPalette()` function in combination with
`colorBrewer`.

``` {r change-color-ramp }
# use colorbrewer which loads with the rasterVis package to generate
# a color ramp of yellow to green
cols <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, "YlGn"))
# create a level plot - plot
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
        main = "Landsat NDVI -- Improved Colors \nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
        col.regions=cols)

```

The yellow to green color ramp visually represents NDVI well given it's a
measure of greenness. Someone looking at the plot can quickly understand that
pixels that are more green, have a higher NDVI value.

## Refine Plot & Tile Labels
Next, let's label each raster in our plot with the Julian day that the raster
represents. The current names come from the band (layer names) stored in the
`RasterStack` and first part each name is the Julian day.

To create a more meaningful label we can remove the "x" and replace it with
"day" using the `gsub()` function in `R`. The syntax is as follows:
`gsub("StringToReplace", "TextToReplaceIt", Robject)`.

First let's remove "_HARV_NDVI_crop" from each label.

```{r clean-up-names }

# view names for each raster layer
names(NDVI_HARV_stack)

# use gsub to modify label names.that we'll use for the plot
rasterNames  <- gsub("X", "Day ", names(NDVI_HARV_stack))

# view Names
rasterNames

# Remove HARV_NDVI_crop from the second part of the string
rasterNames  <- gsub("_HARV_ndvi_crop", "", rasterNames)

# view names for each raster layer
rasterNames
```

> ## Data Tip
> Instead of substituting "x" and
> "_HARV_NDVI_crop" separately, we could have used use the vertical bar character
> ( | ) to replace more than one element.
> For example "X|_HARV" tells `R` to replace all instances of both "X" and "_HARV"
> in the string. Example code to remove "x" an "_HARV...":
> `gsub("X|_HARV_NDVI_crop"," |  ","rasterNames")`
{: .callout}

Once the names for each band have been reassigned, we can render our plot with
the new labels using `names.attr=rasterNames`.

```{r create-levelplot }

# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          layout=c(4, 4), # create a 4x4 layout for the data
          col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
          main = "Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
          names.attr=rasterNames)

```

We can adjust the columns of our plot too using `layout=c(cols, rows)`. Below
we adjust the layout to be a matrix of 5 columns and 3 rows.

```{r adjust-layout }
# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          layout=c(5, 3), # create a 5x3 layout for the data
          col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
          main = "Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
          names.attr=rasterNames)
```

Finally, `scales` allows us to modify the x and y-axis scale. Let's simply
remove the axis ticks from the plot with `scales =list(draw=FALSE)`.

```{r remove-axis-ticks }
# use level plot to create a nice plot with one legend and a 4x4 layout.
levelplot(NDVI_HARV_stack,
          layout=c(5, 3), # create a 5x3 layout for the data
          col.regions=cols, # add a color ramp
          main = "Landsat NDVI - Julian Days \nHarvard Forest 2011",
          names.attr=rasterNames,
          scales=list(draw=FALSE )) # remove axes labels & ticks
```

This episode builds upon
[the previous episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/07-vector-shapefile-attributes-in-r/)
to work with shapefile attributes in `R` and explores how to plot multiple
shapefiles using base R graphics.

## Load the Data
To work with vector data in `R`, we can use the `sf` library. The `raster`
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
raster and vector files. Make sure that you have these libraries loaded.

```{r load-libraries-2, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
```

We will continue to work with the three shapefiles that we loaded in the
[Open and Plot Shapefiles in R]({{site.baseurl}}/06-vector-open-shapefile-in-r/) episode.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")

lines_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_roads.shp")

point_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp")

chm_HARV <-
raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")
```

## Plot Data

In the
[Explore Shapefile Attributes & Plot Shapefile Objects by Attribute Value in R]({{ site.baseurl }}/07-vector-shapefile-attributes-in-r/) episode,
we created a plot where we customized the width of each line in a spatial object
according to a factor level or category. To do this, we create a vector of
colors containing a color value for EACH feature in our spatial object grouped
by factor level or category.

```{r plot-unique-lines }
# create a color palette of 4 colors - one for each factor level
road_palette <- c("blue", "green", "grey", "purple")
road_palette

# create vector of line width values
lineWidth <- c(1, 3, 2, 6)[lines_HARV$TYPE]

# in this case, boardwalk (the first level) is the widest.
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = lineWidth) +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_palette) + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Roads & Trails \nLine Width Varies by Type Attribute Value")
```

> ## Data Tip
> Given we have a factor with 4 levels,
> we can create a vector of numbers, each of which specifies the thickness of each
> feature in our `sf` object by factor level (category): `c(6, 4, 1, 2)[lines_HARV$TYPE]`

## Customize Your Legend
In the [previous episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/),
we also learned how to add a basic legend to our plot.

However, what if we want to create a more complex plot with many shapefiles
and unique symbols that need to be represented clearly in a legend?

Now, let's create a plot that combines our tower location (`point_HARV`),
site boundary (`aoi_boundary_HARV`) and roads (`lines_HARV`) spatial objects. We
will need to build a **custom legend** as well.

To begin, create a plot with the site boundary as the first layer. Then layer
the tower location and road data on top using `+`.

```{r plot-many-shapefiles }
# Plot multiple shapefiles
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV) +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE)) + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Next, let's build a custom legend using the symbology (the colors and symbols)
that we used to create the plot above. For example, it might be good if the lines were symbolized as a line.

```{r }
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_palette) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black") + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Now lets adjust the legend titles by passing a `name` to the respective `color` and `fill` palettes.

```{r create-custom-legend}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type)) +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_palette, name = "Line Type") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black", name = "Tower Location") + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Finally, it might be better if the points were symbolized as a symbol. We can customize this using `shape` parameters in our call to `geom_sf`: **16** is a point symbol, **15** is a box.

```{r custom-symbols }
(gg <- ggplot() + 
         geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey93") +
         geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), shape = 15) +
         geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_palette, name = "Line Type") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black", name = "Tower Location")) + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

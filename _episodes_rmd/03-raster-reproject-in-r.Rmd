Sometimes we encounter raster datasets that do not "line up" when plotted or
analyzed. Rasters that don't line up are most often in different Coordinate
Reference Systems (CRS).

This episode explains how to deal with rasters in different, known CRSs. It
will walk though reprojecting rasters in `R` using the `projectRaster()`
function in the `raster` package.

## Raster Projection in R

In the [Plot Raster Data in R]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/Plot-Rasters-In-R/)
episode, we learned how to layer a raster file on top of a hillshade for a nice
looking basemap. In this episode, all of our data were in the same CRS. What
happens when things don't line up?

For this episode, we will be working with the Harvard Forest Digital
Terrain Model data. This differes from the surface model data we've
we've been working with so far in that the digital terrain model
(DTM) includes the tops of trees, while the digital surface model
(DSM) shows the ground level.

We'll be looking at another model (the canopy height model) in
[a later episode]({{ site.baseurl }}/04-raster-calculations-in-r/index.html) and will see how to calculate the CHM from the
DSM and DTM. Here, we will create a map of the Harvard Forest Digital
Terrain Model
(`DTM_HARV`) draped or layered on top of the hillshade (`DTM_hill_HARV`).

First, we need to import the DTM and DTM hillshade data.

```{r import-DTM-hillshade }
# import DTM
DTM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")

# view data structure
DTM_HARV

# import DTM hillshade
DTM_hill_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_DTMhill_WGS84.tif")

# view data structure
DTM_hill_HARV
```

Next, we will convert each of these datasets to a dataframe.

```{r}
# convert to data.frames
DTM_HARV_df <- DTM_HARV  %>% 
  rasterToPoints(., spatial = TRUE) %>% 
  data.frame()

DTM_hill_HARV_df <- DTM_hill_HARV  %>% 
  rasterToPoints(., spatial = TRUE) %>% 
  data.frame()
```

Now we can create a map of the DTM layered over the hillshade.

```{r}
ggplot() +
     geom_raster(data = DTM_hill_HARV_df, 
                 aes(x = x, y = y, 
                   alpha = HARV_DTMhill_WGS84)
                 ) +
     geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df , 
             aes(x = x, y = y, 
                  fill = HARV_dtmCrop,
                  alpha=0.8)
             ) + 
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
     guides(fill = guide_colorbar()) +
     scale_alpha(range = c(0.25, 0.65), guide = "none") +
     coord_equal()
```

Our results are curious - neither the Digital Terrain Model (`DTM_HARV_df`) 
or the DTM Hillshade (`DTM_hill_HARV_df`) plotted.
Let's try to
plot the DTM on it's own to make sure there are data there.

```{r plot-DTM }
ggplot() +
geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
    fill = HARV_dtmCrop)) +
scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10))
```

Our DTM seems to contain data and plots just fine.

Next we plot the DTM Hillshade on it's own to see whether everything is OK.

```{r plot-DTM-hill}
ggplot() +
geom_raster(data = DTM_hill_HARV_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y,
    alpha = HARV_DTMhill_WGS84))
```

Now we see the problem, the projections of the two rasters are different.
When this is the case, `ggplot` won't render the image, or unforunately,
throw an error message.

Let's next check the
 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the DTM and compare it to our hillshade.

Because the two rasters are in different CRSs, they don't line up when plotted
in `R`. We need to *reproject* `DTM_hill_HARV` into the UTM CRS. Alternatively,
we could project `DTM_HARV` into WGS84.

## Reproject Rasters
We can use the `projectRaster` function to reproject a raster into a new CRS.
Keep in mind that reprojection only works when you first have a *defined* CRS
for the raster object that you want to reproject. It cannot be used if *no*
CRS is defined. Lucky for us, the `DTM_hill_HARV` has a defined CRS.

> ## Data Tip
> When we reproject a raster, we
> move it from one "grid" to another. Thus, we are modifying the data! Keep this
> in mind as we work with raster data.
{: .callout}

To use the `projectRaster` function, we need to define two things:

1. the object we want to reproject and
2. the CRS that we want to reproject it to.

The syntax is `projectRaster(RasterObject, crs = CRSToReprojectTo)`

We want the CRS of our hillshade to match the `DTM_HARV` raster. We can thus
assign the CRS of our `DTM_HARV` to our hillshade within the `projectRaster()`
function as follows: `crs = crs(DTM_HARV)`. 
Note that we are using the `projectRaster()` function on the *raster* object,
not the `data.frame()` we pass to `ggplot`.

```{r reproject-raster }

# reproject to UTM
DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV <- projectRaster(DTM_hill_HARV,
                                       crs = crs(DTM_HARV))

# compare attributes of DTM_hill_UTMZ18N to DTM_hill
crs(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
crs(DTM_hill_HARV)

# compare attributes of DTM_hill_UTMZ18N to DTM_hill
extent(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)
extent(DTM_hill_HARV)

```

Notice in the output above that the `crs()` of `DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV` is now
UTM. However, the extent values of `DTM_hillUTMZ18N_HARV` are different from
`DTM_hill_HARV`.

## Deal with Raster Resolution

Let's next have a look at the resolution of our reprojected hillshade.

```{r view-resolution}

# compare resolution
res(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)

```

The output resolution of `DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV` is 1 x 0.998. Yet, we know that
the resolution for the data should be 1m x 1m. We can tell `R` to force our
newly reprojected raster to be 1m x 1m resolution by adding a line of code
(`res=`).

``` {r reproject-assign-resolution }
# adjust the resolution
DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV <- projectRaster(DTM_hill_HARV,
                                  crs = crs(DTM_HARV),
                                  res = 1)
# view resolution
res(DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV)

```

Let's plot our newly reprojected raster.

```{r plot-projected-raster }
# convert the reprojected raster to a data.frame()

DTM_hill_HARV_2_df <- DTM_hill_UTMZ18N_HARV  %>% 
                          rasterToPoints(., spatial = TRUE) %>% 
                          data.frame()

ggplot() +
     geom_raster(data = DTM_hill_HARV_2_df, 
                 aes(x = x, y = y, 
                   alpha = HARV_DTMhill_WGS84)
                 ) +
     geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df , 
             aes(x = x, y = y, 
                  fill = HARV_dtmCrop,
                  alpha=0.8)
             ) + 
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10))
```

We have now successfully draped the Digital Terrain Model on top of our
hillshade to produce a nice looking, textured map!

If you completed the San Joaquin plotting challenge in the
[Plot Raster Data in R]({{ site.baseurl }}/R/Plot-Rasters-In-R#challenge-create-dtm--dsm-for-sjer)
episode, how does the map you just created compare to that map?

```{r challenge-code-reprojection2, echo=FALSE}
# The maps look identical. Which is what they should be as the only difference
# is this one was reprojected from WGS84 to UTM prior to plotting.
```
